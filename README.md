# PAVO 

Pavo - The latin translation of peacock 

We are Yu Cheng, Jeff, Joenz and Ruoyan, and this web app serves to answer the Second Problem Statement about Education: 
As technology rapidly infiltrates the eeducation sector and changes not just the way people learn, but also how people teach,
what refreshing ideas do you ahve to make learning and / or teaching more safe, exciting and effective? 

## Our motivation 

In this post covid world, hybrid learning is the new normal. Students can be in a classroom and their education is augmented
with technology, or educators can teach remotely from the comfort of their homes. Pavo aims to make the transition to hybrid
learning easy. 

Pavo is a virtual whiteboard that allows for collaboration between teachers and students.

Peacocks love to display their colourful feathers. Similarly, in classrooms, we hope that students have the courage to show 
off their knowledge and answers. It is a common experience for students who are more introverted to stay quiet in class due 
to the reluctance to raise their hands or walk to the whiteboard. With this application, shy students can choose to submit 
answers anonymously to the teachers while the teachers look at their screens that consist of all students’ whiteboards in 
real time. Eventually, learning experience in a classroom setting is enhanced, as students are more willing to contribute to 
class discussions, while teachers are enabled to better understand students’ struggles.
